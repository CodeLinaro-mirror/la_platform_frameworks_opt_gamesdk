// Characterisation tests for the frame-time accumulator.

// These describe what the shipping code does today, not what it ideally would.

// change the inputs that decision is made from. Everything asserted here was
// read off the implementation, not designed.
//
// That this file compiles at all is part of the point: the accumulator was
// nested inside SwappyCommon, which includes jni.h, so none of it was reachable
// from a host test before.
