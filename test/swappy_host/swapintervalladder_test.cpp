// Characterisation tests for the swap interval ladder.
//
// These describe what the shipping ladder does, not what it ideally would. The
// ladder had no tests before; it was extracted from SwappyCommon precisely so
// it could have some, and the lock-in work that follows is going to change it,
// so what it does today needs pinning down first.
//
// Every expectation here was read off the implementation and then confirmed
// against the pre-refactor code by a one-off differential run over 267 million
// enumerated inputs. That run is not committed -- a permanent second copy of
// the ladder is the drift this refactor removes -- so these tests are what
// remains of it. They were sized by re-running the same ten mutations the
// differential was checked against, and catch all ten.
//
// Several assertions look like bugs. They are marked where they do; the point
// of a characterisation test is to record the behaviour, not to endorse it.
